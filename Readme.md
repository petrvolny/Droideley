Droideley - The Unofficial Mendeley Android Client
==================================================
[DEPRECATED]
Droideley is an Android client for [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) (ultimate scientific reference manager)
Feel free to take it and develop it further. I have no time to maintain and develop new features to this project.

It uses [Mendeley OAPI](http://dev.mendeley.com/) to access user data.
